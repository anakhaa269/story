        Once upon a time, in the magical halls of the University of Awesome, there was a brilliant student named <strong>${name}</strong>.
        Known for their curiosity and a backpack full of snacks, ${name} accidentally discovered a new element during a chemistry experiment:
        <em>Snackonium</em>.

        Dr. Eleanor Gaye, the head of the science faculty, was impressed. "This is the most delicious discovery we've ever made!" she said.

        ${name} was awarded the title "Snack Scientist of the Year" and went on to invent edible robots that danced like chickens.

        And from that day on, ${name}'s name was written in the stars... and on the cafeteria menu.
